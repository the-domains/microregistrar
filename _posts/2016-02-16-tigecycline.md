**Nature**:  
Glycylcycline, member of tetracycline family. Semisynthetic derivative of minocycline.

**MW**: 585.6

**Mechanism of action**:  
1\. Bind to 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis.  
It inhibit attachment of aminoacyl tRNA to A site and prevent chain elongation, i.e. block translation process.

2\. Inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis by binding to 70 S ribosome (parasites).

**Mechanism of resistance**:  
1\. Overexpression of efflux pump:  
mepA -MATE family of efflux pump -- Staph aureus.  
Multidrug efflux pump (AcrAB/AcrEF/AdeABC) -- gram negatives  
Multdrug efflux pump (MexXY) -- Pseudomonas

2\. Enzymatic modification:  
tetX mediated.

**Route**: IV

**Caution/contraindication**:  
1\. Avoid in children 3\. Avoid in pregnancy.  
4\. May increase INR when used with warfarin. May increase PT, aPTT.

**PK/PD**:  
1\. Protein binding: 80%  
2\. Food improves tolerability.  
3\. Tissue to plasma conc ratio- high. Low conc in serum.  
4\. T1/2 37-66hr  
5\. AUC/MIC is important parameter.

**Excretion**:  
Liver. Renal clearence 

**Adverse effect**:  
GI side effects (nausea, vomiting)- commonest.  
transient increase in ALT, AST, alk phos.  
Potential tooth discolouration and inhibition of bone growth if used in children (or pregnancy) -- no data.  
Rare: Hyperpigmentation, electrolyte imbalance, dizziness, vaginitis etc.

**Use**:  
Skin and soft tissue infection.  
Intraabdominal infection.

_**Tetracycline and Tigecycline**_

1. _Tigecycline belongs to tetracycline family, it is a minocycline derivative_
2. _It attaches to 30S ribosome like tetracycline and prevent protein synthesis, however it also binds to ribosomal binding site and binding is much stronger than tetracycline._
3. _It is not affected by ribosomal binding site protection  (tetM, tetO mediated) which confers tetracycline resistance._

_**Spectrum**_

_Gram positive:_  
_MSSA, MRSA, Streptococcus, Enterococcus including VRE, Listeria, Coryne -- S._  
_Gram negative:_  
_Enterobactericeae (Proteus, Providencia, Moganella  has high MIC) is S. Acinetobacter, stenotrophomonas, Neisseria -S._  
_Pseudomonas R, Burkholderia -may be resistant._  
_Anaerobe:_  
_Sensitive including C difficile. Some B fragilis may be resistant._  
_Atypcals:_  
_Mycoplasma, Chlamydia -S, Legionalla may have high MIC._  
_Rapid growing mycobacteria: fortutum, abscessus, chelonae, smegmatis -- S._

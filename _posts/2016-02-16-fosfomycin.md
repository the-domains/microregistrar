**N****ature**:   
Phosphoenolpyruvate analogue, manufactured synthetically, but originally obtained from Streptomyces fradiae, Pseudomonas sp.

**MW:** 138

**Mechanism of action:**  
Inhibit bacterial cell wall formation by inactivating enolpyruvate transferase (MurA).  
Synergy: It shows the synergistic / additive effect with many antibiotics against St. aureus, E coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus, Providencia etc.

**Mechanism of resistance:**  
1\. Plasmid borne, enzyme inactivation:  
fosA gene mediated glutathione transferase (gram negative, gram positives).  
fosB Magnesium depenedent transferase (gram positive, S epidermidis).fosX Manganese depenedent hydrolase (Listeria etc)

2\. Chromosome mutation, preventing the entry of the antibiotic into bacterial cell by inhibiting transport mechanism:  
Several variations can be seen in gram negatives, including  E coli.  
This resistance may be associated with a fitness cost.

**Route:**  
IV, PO.

**PK/PD:**  
Metabolism: Excreted unchanged in urine and feces.  
Excretion: Mainly renal.  
Bioavailability:  approx 40% (tromethamine).

**Common adverse effects:**  
Gastrointestinal adverse effects, vaginitis, headache.

**Use:**  
UTI  
Often used in combination with another antibiotic for various indications.  
Surgical prophylaxis.

_**Spectrum:**_  
Gram positive-  
_Staph aureus, including MRSA, (GISA may be resistant), Enterococcus -- S._  
_Staph saprophyticus may be resistant_  
_Streptococcus (including GAS/GBS) -- variable. Many alpha haemolytic Streptococcus are resistant._  
Gram negative_:_  
_E coli, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis (icludig ESBL, MBL)- sensitive._  
_Enterobacter, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia, Serratia may be resistant._  
_Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Morganella -- Resistant._  
Anaerobes:  
_Not active._

**Nature**

* Fermentation product of Pseudomonas fluorescence.

**Mechanism of action**

* It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the bacterial isoleucyl transfer -RNA synthetase. This mechanism is unique and hence no cross resistance with other antibiotics has been reported.

**Mechanism of resistance**

* Low level resistance -- Chromosomal; MIC 8-256;  point mutation in ileS gene coding for isoleucyl tRNA synthetase.

* High level resistance -- Plasmid; MIC512; mupA mediated additional isoleucyl tRNA transferase.
* Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria, Bordetella, Pasteurella sensitive.
* Chances of resistance development increases -- in long-term use, use in presence of foreign body (NG tube), decubitus ulcer.

**PK/PD**

* Inactivated in plasma and hence it is only used topically.

* Bacteriostatic near MIC and bactericidal at higher concentration.

* Poorly absorbed when used topically, absorbed drug get metabolised in the liver.

**Spectrum**

* Staph aureus (including MRSA, VISA, VRSA), strep, CoNS, Enterococci, Strep bovis has high MIC, Micrococcus resistant. Corynebacterium and anaerobic gram positives are resistant.

**Adverse effect**

* Burning, stinging, itching, rash, headache.

* Mupirocin prep containing polyethylene glycol should be used with caution in renal impairment.

**Use**

* Eradication regimen for MRSA -- anterior nares BD X 5 days.

* NOT indicated for the prophylaxis of clean surgical wounds.

**Nature**

* Oxazolidinone, synthetic, bacteriostatic (except some strains of pneumococcus, B fragilis and Cl perfringens)

* Inhibit toxin production of staph and strepto in sub-MIC conc.

* May antagonise the action of gentamicin.

**Mechanism of action**

* Inhibit protein synthesis by binding to 50S ribosome.

**Mechanism of resistance**

* Reported in Staph aureus, CoNS, Enterococci, viridans strep/

* Target site mutation in 23S rRNA -- not transferable
* cfr gene mediated enzymatic modification of 23s rRNA -- transferable.
* Risk factors, for developing resistance --
* Prolonged use, presence of the irremovable indwelling device, sequestered infection, low dose therapy for VRE/MRSA.

* Cross resistance can be seen with chloramphenicol.

**Spectrum**

* All major gram positive organisms, some mycobacteria and Nocardia.

* Some gram negative anaerobes -- Bacteroides, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas.
* Bacteristatic against Coxiella.

* No activity inside biofilm.

**PK/PD**

* 95% oral bioavailability.

* Mostly metabolised in the liver (65%) and kidney.
* Renal excretion -- 50%.
* A post antibiotic effect seen in Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.
* Good penetration in bone, inflamed diabetic foot, fat, muscle, blister fluid, kidney, liver, GIT.

* Non-inflamed meninges- CSF: Plasma = 0.7/1\.

**Adverse effect**

* Diarrhoea (MC), nausea, headache, vaginal candidiasis (1%), metallic taste (0.9%).

* Incidence of C difficile -- 0.2%.
* Myelosuppression (2 weeks treatment, reversible, more common in renal impairment),
* Peripheral neuropathy (irreversible),
* Optic neuropathy (reversible) and
* Lactic acidosis (may appear after 7 days).

* (From inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis mainly after 28 days treatment).

**Caution**

* Weak MAOI -- co-administration of SSRI (or taken within 2 weeks), TCA or MAOI can cause serotonin syndrome.

* Co- administration of sympathomimetics, vasopressors or dopaminergic agents may increase the pressor effect.

**Use**

* Community-acquired pneumonia.

* Nosocomial pneumonia Skin. Soft-tissue infections.

* Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.

**Dose**

* IV/PO.

* 600 MB BD.

* Children -- not licensed in UK

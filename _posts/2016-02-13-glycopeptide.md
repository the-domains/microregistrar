Nature:   
Group 1 glycopeptide.

Obtained from:  
Amycolatopsis orientalis. Previously called 'Mississipi mud' for impurities, new preparations are however 90% pure.

Machanism of resistance:  
VRSA - vanA.  
VISA - Increased number of DADA, vancomycin get sequestred within the cell wall by extra DADA and do not reach its binding site.  
VRE - Related to avoparcin use or prolonged stay in hospital/glycopeptide use. 

Types -   
vanA (E faeciumE faecalis, E durans; high level R to teic and vanc),   
vanB (Chromosomal, inducible, E faecalis mostly, low/mod R to vanc only),   
vanC (Chromosomal, low lvl vanc only R, E gallinarum, casseliflavus),         vanD, vanE, vanF. 

More common in E faecium. Acquired ampicillin resistance is a marker of nosocomial E faecium in Europe and may precede vanc resistance by few years.

van gene encode for a low affinity alternative for DADA - D-Ala-D-lac/D-Ala-D-ser.

Spectrum:

Gram positive organisms -   
Exception - Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, erysipelothrix, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus casseliflavus.

Not cidal to Enterococcus.   
Some St epidermidis may have high MIC (produces slime)

##### **Erythromycin**

**Nature**:

* Macrolide, derived from saccharopolyspora.

**Mechanism of action:**

* Binds to 50S ribosomal RNA.
* Prevent elongation of the peptide chain.
* It interacts with peptidyl transferase and blocks RNA dependent protein synthesis at chain elongation stage.

**Mechanism of resistance:**

* Impermeability- Enterobacteriaceae are intrinsically resistant. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter.
* Efflux pump- mefA (streptococcus, Pneumococcus). msrA (Staphylococci).
* Enzymatic inactivation -- phosphotransferase and esterase (E coli, Nocardia).
* MLSB -- Alteration of 23S RNA by methylation of adenine -- encoded by erm gene. It confers resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (type B). It does not affect ketolides (Telithromycin). MLSB is inducible.

Pneumococcus R -- as high as 60-80%, Group A Strep is also becoming resistant.

**PK/PD:**

* PO/IV.
* Enhance GI motility.
* Widely distributed.
* It gets concentrated in neutrophils, bronchial mucosa and tonsil.
* Induce CYP450\.
* Renal impairment : adjust dose.

**Spectrum:**

* Most gram positives, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Moraxella, Bordetella, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, M kansasi; gram positive and gram negative anaerobes (not B fragilis, Fusobacterium).
* Poor activity against enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters. Nocardia.

**Adverse effect:**

* Gastrointestinal, rash.
* Eosinophilia, cholestatic jaundice (estolate).
* Hepatotoxicity (idiosyncratic)
* Transient hearing loss.
* QT prolongation, torsade.
* Candidiasis,
* Infantile pyloric stenosis.

**Clinical use:**

* Community acquired and atypical pneumonia, pertussis prophylaxis/treatment, Campylobacter gastroenteritis.
* Prophylaxis for splenectomised patients (penicillin allergic).
* Non gonococcal urethritis.
* Prophylaxis -- diphtheria, group A streptococcus, PneumococcusProkinetic.Dose varies (to check BNF).

##### **Clarythromycin**

**Nature**:

* Semisynthetic.

**Mechanism of action**:

* Same as erythromycin.

**Mechanism of resistance:**

* Same as erythromycin.

**PK/PD:**

* IV/PO.
* Bioavailability up to 60%.
* Mainly metabolised in liver.
* Renal impairment: adjust dose.
* Excretion: faeces mostly, some in urine.

**Spectrum:**

* Campylobacter, Rhodococcus, Borrelia, Propionibacterium,
* Gardnerella, Mobilincus, Treponema.
* Chlamydia, Legionella, MAC, M leprae, Rickettsia.

**Adverse effect:**

* GI disturbance,dyspepsia,  dysguesia
* Hepatic dysfunction.
* Tooth discolouration
* Glossitis, stomatitis etc.

**Use:**

* Respiratory tract infection -- community acquired pneumonia, useful for atypical pneumonia.
* H pylori eradication -- in combination,
* Skin and soft tissue infection,
* Non tuberculous mycobacteria treatment.
* Pertussis, Lyme disease.

##### **Azithromycin (Azalide)**

**Nature**:

* Semisynthetic.

**Mechanism of action**:

* Same as erythromycin.

**Mechanism of resistance:**

* Same as erythromycin.

**PK/PD:**

* Long half-life, once daily administration, mainly metabolised in liver and excreted in faeces.

**Spectrum:**

* Similar to erythromycin (slightly less active against gram positive bacteria) but **more active against** Brucella, Ureaplasma, mycoplasma and Haemophilus influenzae, babesia, Cryptosporidia, It is also active against E coli, Salmonella and Shigella.

**Adverse effect:**

* GI disturbance, dysguesia, headache, arthralgia etc.

**Clinical use**:

* Respiratory infection, skin and soft tissue infection.
* Babesia, borrelia, trachoma.
* Uncomplicated gonorrhoea, NGU, chlamydia etc.

##### **Spiramycin**

**Nature:**

* Macrolide

**Mechanism of action: **

* Same as erythromycin.

**Mechanism of resistance: **

* Same as erythromycin.

**PK/PD:**

* Do not induce CYP450, mostly excreted in bile.

* Post antibiotic effect.

**Spectrum:**

* Legionella, campylobacter,  anaerobes including bacteroides, toxoplasma.

* Mostly bacteriostatic.

**Adverse effect:**

* GI side effects.

**Use**

* RTI,Toxoplasma (pregnancy), Cryptosporidiosis.

**Points to remember:**

* Can cause arrhythmias -- QT prolongation

* Not licensed (UK).

##### **Telithromycin (Ketolide)**

**Nature**:

* Ketolide.

**Mechanism of action**:

* Similar to erythromycin.

**Mechanism of resistance**:

* As erythromycin but poor inducer of efflux pump and MLSb.

**PK/PD:**

* Good oral absorption and bioavailability. Metabolised in liver -- CYP.

**Spectrum:**

* GPC, GNC, GPR, fastidious GNR, Atypical mycobacteria, anaerobes, intracellular pathogens, atypicals, T pallidum. Bactericidal against pneumococcus.

**Adverse effect:**

* GI SE.

**Use:**

* CAP, AECOPD.

**Note: **

* Check for QT prolongation/history of QT prolongation.
* Check for myesthenia gravis.
* Suggest it may impair driving/ working with machinery \[minimise these activity\] -- visual disturbance/fainting may happen.
* Monitor for hepatic dysfunction.
* Do not use with drugs which can cause QT prolongation.

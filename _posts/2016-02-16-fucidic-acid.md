**Nature**

* Antibiotic with steroid like structure, but they do not have the hormonal or anti-inflammatory effect (different stereochemistry).

* Obtained from fungus fusidium.

* Bactericidal. 

**Mechanism of action**

* Inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. It binds to elongation factor G (EF-G) on the ribosome and prevent translocation of peptidyl tRNA.

**Mechanism of resistance**

* Chromosomal fusA, and plasmid fusB, fusC, fusD mediated.

* fusA -- reduced affinity of fusidic acid for its target EF-G (elongation factor).
* fusB-D -- Produce a protein that protects EF-G.
* fusE -- inducible by aminoglycoside.

* Enzymatic inactive.

**Spectrum**

* Most gram positive bacteria including MRSA (Streptococcus and pneumococcus are less susceptible than staph). Aerobic gram negatives are resistant. Moderate activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M leprae, M malmoense, M bovis. Some activity against Giardia and Plasmodium.

**PK/PD**

* Oral absorption 90%.

* T1/2 -- 9h.
* PP binding -- 97%.
* Mostly metabolised in the liver.

* Distribution -- does not penetrate CSF, but goes in cerebral abscess. Good levels are achieved in muscle, kidney, bone, joint fluid, pleural fluid, lungs; cross placenta, secreted in milk.

**Adverse effect**.

* GI symptoms, rash, abnormal LFT, jaundice. Not recommended in liver insufficiency.

**Indication**

* Staphylococcal infection with other agents -- bone/ joint.

****

**Note**

Fusidin monotherapy, topical use, prolonged use increases the chance of development of resistance on therapy.
